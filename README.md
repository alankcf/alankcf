<h2 align="center">About Me</h1>

I am an first year Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver, BC! I expect to graduate by 2027. My interests include the applications of computers in transportation, security, and user experience. Outside of school, you'll probably catch me playing the piano, hiking, and exploring the West Coast. I appreciate your visit. Please feel free to reach out on Linkedin!

<h2 align="center">What I've Been Working On</h1>

#### :desktop_computer: [Personal Website](https://alankcf.github.io)

A very first personal website as a method to learn HTML and CSS, with a dip into Javascript. Though this Github Pages site, I've learnt a lot about the basics of web design and its applications. Please note this is still a work in progress!

#### :heavy_plus_sign: [Calculator](https://github.com/alankcf/terminalcalculator)

A program that I wrote I think sums nicely what I've learn from a first year computer science course based on the C programming language. This program prompts users for a mathematical expression between two numbers, all in one line, until the user ends the program.
