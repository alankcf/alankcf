## About Me

I am an first year Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver, BC! I would love for you to explore some of the things I've been up to, see what I've uploaded here, or reach out.

## What I've Been Doing

#### :desktop_computer: [Personal Website](https://alankcf.github.io)

A very first personal website as a method to learn HTML and CSS, with a dip into Javascript. Though this Github Pages site, I've learnt a lot about the basics of web design and its applications and gained appreciation for everyday web applications. Please note this is still a work in progress!

#### :heavy_plus_sign: [Calculator](https://github.com/alankcf/terminalcalculator)

A program that applying what I've learnt so far in C programming. This program evaluates users input of a mathematical expression in one line, repeatedly until the user ends the program.

#### :video_game: Processing (in Java) Game Projects

A collection of a few projects I made through Processing in Java. Includes classic arcade games such as [Asteroids](https://github.com/alankcf/AsteroidsProject), [Atari Breakout](https://github.com/alankcf/BreakoutProject), [Dungeon Crawl](https://github.com/alankcf/DungeonsProject), [Pong Arcade](https://github.com/alankcf/ProjectPong), and [more](https://github.com/alankcf?tab=repositories)!
